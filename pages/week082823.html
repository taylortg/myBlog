                This week I set out to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to create 
                basic pages with some really simple styling. I am a big believer 
                in learning fundamentals before venturing head first into the tools 
                that help to make web devlopement a lot easier. It is like in engineering
                when dealing with a difficult problem, it is important to have sound
                fundamentals in order to think from <em>first principles</em> in order
                to engage with the problem properly.
